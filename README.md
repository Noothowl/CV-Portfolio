# 💼 CV & Portfolio — Monorepo

A lightweight monorepo that automates both:
1. **CV compilation** → from LaTeX → PDF → auto-deployed.
2. **Portfolio site** → built with Next.js → hosted on GitHub Pages.

Everything is designed to stay self-contained and updatable through GitHub Actions.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🧾 1. CV Compilation
- The workflow uses [`xu-cheng/latex-action`](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action)
- It compiles your `.tex` source and commits the generated `cv.pdf` into `public/`.
- The PDF is then accessible directly from your portfolio.

### 💻 2. Portfolio Site
- Built with **Next.js 14** using static export mode (`next export`).
- Styled through a **modular CSS theme** (`globals.css`) with tunable tokens:
  - color palette, radius, shadow depth, accent glow.
- The design focuses on:
  - transparent “glass” cards
  - designer-friendly variables
  - adaptive layout for any resolution.

### 🔁 3. Automated Deployment
- CI runs LaTeX → copies PDF → builds static site → pushes `/out` to `gh-pages`.
- No manual step required.
- If only your CV changes, the PDF will update automatically without rebuilding the app.
