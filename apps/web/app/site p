<p>   Hello, and welcome! This portfolio showcases projects that truly represent my skills and passions in game development.

                  I'm a 23-year-old developer actively seeking professional experience—a lifelong dream. My passion for games started at age 6, leading to experimentation with programming tools and game mods by age 13. I've since developed a strong affinity for GameMaker and Robotics.

                  My focus is on creating dynamic, modular, and scalable game systems that offer players multiple possibilities and enable efficient content creation. My design philosophy, heavily influenced by roguelikes and looters, prioritizes meaningful progression over excessive grinding.

                  Critically, I combine programming proficiency with a strong foundation in artistic skills like 3D modeling and animation. This technical and creative blend allows me to effectively bridge the gap between code and art, ensuring clear communication with all team members.

                  I hope you enjoy exploring the interactive project cards below!
